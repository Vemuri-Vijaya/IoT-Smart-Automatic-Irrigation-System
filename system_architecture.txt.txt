SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The IoT Based Smart Automatic Irrigation System follows a simple edge and cloud based architecture.

Soil Moisture Sensor:
The soil moisture sensor is placed in the soil to continuously measure the moisture content.

ESP32 Microcontroller:
The ESP32 acts as the edge device. It reads data from the soil moisture sensor, applies threshold logic, and controls the water pump automatically.

Relay Module:
The relay module is used to switch the water pump ON or OFF based on ESP32 control signals.

Water Pump:
The water pump supplies water to the field when soil moisture is below the required level.

Wi-Fi Connectivity:
ESP32 uses Wi-Fi to send sensor data to the cloud platform.

Cloud Platform:
The cloud stores sensor data and allows remote monitoring of soil moisture and pump status.

This architecture ensures real time monitoring, automatic control, and reduced water wastage.
