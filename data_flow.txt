DATA FLOW

Step 1:
The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture content present in the soil.

Step 2:
The sensor sends analog data to the ESP32 microcontroller.

Step 3:
ESP32 processes the sensor value and compares it with the predefined threshold.

Step 4:
If soil moisture is below the threshold, the ESP32 turns the water pump ON using a relay.
If soil moisture is above the threshold, the ESP32 turns the water pump OFF.

Step 5:
ESP32 sends sensor readings and pump status to the cloud using Wi-Fi.

Step 6:
The data can be monitored remotely for analysis and decision making.

This data flow enables automated irrigation with minimal human intervention.
